    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>4 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef;
            cook and stir until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in black beans
            and red bell pepper; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut four 13x13-inch pieces of aluminum foil. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place 1 tortilla on each piece of aluminum foil. Spoon beef mixture
            in a line down the center of each tortilla. Divide cheese evenly 
            among tortillas. Fold opposing edges of each tortilla to overlap 
            the filling. Roll up in the shape of a burrito, sealing ends. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Rinse and dry 4 half-gallon wax-lined milk cartons. Cut several 
            1-inch diamond-shaped vents into 2 corners of each milk carton, 
            near the bottom. Place a wrapped burrito inside each carton. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place milk cartons in a safe cooking area outdoors. Light each on 
            fire at one of the vents; cook until cartons burn down, about 2 minutes. 
            Gently unwrap burritos with heatproof gloves. 
        </li>
    </ol>
