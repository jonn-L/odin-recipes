    <h1>Campfire Pepperoni Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../images/pizza.webp" alt="Very Delicious-Looking Pizza">
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        The smokey flavor from the wood fire puts a great twist on an old 
        favorite and with the help of a pizza stone, doing this over an open 
        fire is easier than you may think," says recipe creator 
        <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/3816874/">gonefishn</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound refrigerated pizza dough</li>
        <li>¼ cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced pepperoni</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place pizza stone on grill directly over wood fire. You may need 
            to begin by spreading out the wood if the flames are too tall. 
            Roll out the pizza dough to desired thickness. Place it on the 
            pizza stone and cook 10 minutes on one side until golden.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the fire and on the cooked side, spread the pizza 
            sauce in an even layer over dough leaving about a half inch around 
            the rim of the pizza dough bare. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly
            on top of the sauce, followed by the pepperoni slices. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place uncooked side down, back on the pizza stone. Cover with a 
            foil tent and cook until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes more. 
            Transfer pizza to a cutting board and let cool slightly before 
            cutting and serving. 
        </li>
    </ol>
